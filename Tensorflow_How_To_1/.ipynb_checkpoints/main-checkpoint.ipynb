    "TensorFlow is a library for number crunching created and maintained by Google. It’s used mainly for machine learning (especially deep learning) tasks. While still in beta (version 1.0 is currently in alpha), the library was open sourced more than a year ago (November 9, 2015). Since then it pretty much took the Deep Learning (DL) community by a storm. Tons of companies are using it in production, also. The best place to learn more is the official page of TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the more technical side, TensorFlow allows you to do computations on your PC/Mac (CPU & GPU), Android, iOS and lots more places. Of course, being created by Google, it aims to bring massive parallelism to your backprop musings. The main abstraction behind all the magic is stateful dataflow graphs.\n",

    "\n",

    "- A computational graph is a series of TensorFlow operations (*nodes/vertices*) connected by tensors (*edges/connections*)\n",
    "- The graph is composed of two types of objects:\n",
    "    1. ***tf.Operation (or \"ops\")***\n",
    "        - The nodes of the graph\n",
    "        - Operations describe calculations that consume and produce tensors (constant, addition, log, matmul, etc.)\n",
    "    2. ***tf.Tensor***\n",
    "        - The edges in the graph\n",
    "        - These represent the values that will flow through the graph (inputs and outputs of various operations)\n",
    "        - Most TensorFlow functions return tf.Tensors\n",
    "        \n",
    "--------------\n",
    "**An Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a TensorFlow graph, the <span style=\"color:red\">tf.matmul operation</span> would correspond to a <span style=\"color:red\">single node</span> with <span style=\"color:blue\">two incoming edges/tensors (the matrices to be multiplied)</span> and <span style=\"color:blue\">one outgoing edge/tensor (the result of the multiplication)</span>  \n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "**Even More Information (Skip This Section If You'd Like...):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most TensorFlow programs start with a dataflow graph construction phase. In this phase, you invoke TensorFlow API functions that construct new <span style=\"color:red\">tf.Operation (node)</span> and <span style=\"color:blue\">tf.Tensor (edge)</span> objects and add them to a tf.Graph instance. TensorFlow provides a default graph that is an implicit argument to all API functions in the same context\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "    - Calling tf.constant(42.0) creates a single <span style=\"color:red\">tf.Operation</span> that produces the value 42.0, adds it to the default graph, and returns a <span style=\"color:blue\">tf.Tensor</span> that represents the value of the constant\n",
    "    - Calling tf.matmul(x, y) creates a single <span style=\"color:red\">tf.Operation</span> that multiplies the values of <span style=\"color:blue\">tf.Tensor objects x and y</span>, adds it to the default graph, and returns a <span style=\"color:blue\">tf.Tensor that represents the result of the multiplication</span>\n",
    "    - Executing v = tf.Variable(0) adds to the graph a <span style=\"color:red\">tf.Operation</span> that will store a <span style=\"color:blue\">writeable tensor value</span> that persists between tf.Session.run calls\n",
    "        - The tf.Variable object wraps this operation, and can be used like a tensor, which will read the current value of the stored value\n",
    "        - The tf.Variable object also has methods such as tf.Variable.assign and tf.Variable.assign_add that create tf.Operation objects that, when executed, update the stored value. (We will discuss variables more in depth later)\n",
    "    - Calling tf.train.Optimizer.minimize will add <span style=\"color:red\">operations</span> and <span style=\"color:blue\">tensors</span> to the default graph that calculates gradients, and return a <span style=\"color:red\">tf.Operation</span> that, when run, will apply those gradients to a set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "**Important: tf.Tensors do not have values, they are just handles to elements in the computation graph** \n",
    "\n",
    "*Calling most functions in the TensorFlow API merely adds operations and tensors to the default graph, but does not perform the actual computation.   \n",
    "You compose functions until you have a tf.Tensor or tf.Operation that represents the overall computation (blueprint), i.e. Performing one step of gradient descent, and then pass that object to a tf.Session to perform the computation (Note: **Sessions** will be covered in more detail later)*\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "Let's build a simple computational graph to help illustrate the principles:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic **operation** is a ***constant***. The Python function that builds the **operation** takes a **tensor value** as *input*. The resulting **operation** takes *no inputs*. When run, it outputs the value that was passed to the ***constructor***.    \n",

    "    1. Find out how related the two (or more) variables are to each other\n",
    "        - Basically applying linear regression gives us a number between -1 and 1 that gives us an indication of the the strength of correlation between two variables.\n",
    "            -  ***0*** means no correlation\n",
    "            -  ***1*** means they are positively correlated (an ***increase in X*** means an ***increase in Y***)\n",
    "            -  ***-1*** means negatively correlated (***increase in X*** means a ***decrease in Y*** and vice versa).\n",
    "    2. We can use linear regression for prediction\n",
    "        - i.e. If we know the rough relationship between ***X*** and ***Y***, then we can use this relationship to predict values of ***Y*** for a new value of ***X*** that we are curious about\n",

    "\n",
    "![linear regression](inline_images/linear_regression.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "  \n",
    "Lets say ***X*** is the ***number of workers*** painting a house and ***Y*** is the ***amount of time*** needed to finish a job.   \n",
    "You do several jobs with different numbers of workers and you time how much it takes to finish each job.\n",
    "\n",
    "We put those numbers on a graph and do simple linear regression and we learn 2 things:   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does increasing the number of workers really decrease the time needed to finish a job? (i.e. are they correlated and how much)\n",
    "\n",
    "        --> The HOW MUCH part, is where the slope comes in\n",
    "        --> Slope is the RATE OF CHANGE of Y with respect to X               <<<<  m = Δy/Δx = rise/run  >>>>\n",
    "            --> i.e. if we change X by 1, how much does Y change!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we get a customer who wants the job done in a very short time, then we can use our study to predict how many workers it might need to finish it  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The other factor to take into consideration is the offset or *bias* (represented by the symbol b); in some models if we decrease the independent variable to nothing yet some value for y (dependant value) still remains, then there is some offset inherent in the model; this offset is denoted as b.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "***NOTE:***\n",
